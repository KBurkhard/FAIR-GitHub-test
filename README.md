# What should/will the learning objective(s) be?

## Understand Git's concepts of the staging area

##Go through the modify-add-commit cycle a few times in a demo project (approx. episodes 2 to 4 of git-novice).
What do participants need to know / install / bring?
some demo text (own abstract, "About" text of your university, any bunch of sentences)
own laptop with installed Git and a text-editor (if you have none, yet, Atom.io is a good compromise)
